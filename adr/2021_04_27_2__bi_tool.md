# Use 3d party BI tool for reporting
## Status
Accepted
## Context
A custom solution is used for generating reports. It is old and it is not easy to extend it.
## Decision
* Onboard a business intelligence and data visualization tool with an intuitive user interface so managers can create necessary reports without coding knowledge. We choose between Tableau and Power BI, we are going to present both to the business with feature/cost analysis and let them decide.
* Migrate existing reports to the new tool
## Consequences
It will be much easier to create new reports. We can save development effort.
